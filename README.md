Research report identifying gaps in online visibility for a niche industry and proposed digital solution.

#1.Identified Industry or Sector:

Sector: Handloom Cooperatives in Telangana
Telangana boasts a strong handloom tradition, and the cooperative sector plays a vital role in supporting its weavers. The Telangana State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society (TSCO) is the apex body, established in 2016 after bifurcation from the Andhra Pradesh State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society (APCO). TSCO has 380 primary handloom weaver cooperative societies affiliated with it, providing work to around 13,000 weavers across the state. These cooperatives are crucial for organizing production, marketing, and sales of handloom products like Pochampally, Gadwal, Narayanpet sarees, and Warangal durries.  

Key Organizations and Initiatives:

•	TSCO (Telangana State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society):
As the apex body, TSCO oversees the primary societies, manages marketing and sales activities, and provides training to weavers. 

•	Primary Handloom Weaver Cooperatives:
These societies are the foundation of the cooperative structure, directly supporting the weavers by providing them with work, resources, and a platform to sell their products. 

•	Handloom Clusters:
Telangana has renowned handloom clusters like Pochampally, Gadwal, Ikat, Narayanpet, Gollabhama sarees known for their unique weaving styles and techniques. 

•	Chenetha Mitra Scheme:
This scheme provides financial assistance to weavers, including a 50% subsidy on certain expenses and a monthly stipend. 
Working of the Cooperatives:

•	The cooperatives arrange for the training of weavers in improved weaving methods.

•	They handle the marketing and sales of handloom products through their own outlets and other channels.

•	TSCO, in particular, manages a network of outlets, including some in Northern India, to showcase and sell the handloom products.


#2.Current Online Presence:
Despite their heritage and scale, the digital footprint of Telangana’s handloom cooperatives is fragmented:

•	Telangana State Handloom Department website:
TSCO is mentioned on the official Telangana State Handloom Department website. While TSCO is making efforts to expand its online presence, particularly through e-commerce, the current online presence is not robust or widely used. They rely heavily on their traditional marketing channels and government support. Many local cooperatives lack individual web presence.
      Most sales still rely on offline exhibitions, government orders, or middlemen, limiting reach and visibility.

•	Other Online Platforms:
While TSCO's website is a primary online platform, other online marketplaces and platforms likely carry Telangana handloom products due to the growing trend of online shopping in the handloom sector, especially since the pandemic. 


#3. Key Gaps and Challenges:

Missing Information	Root Causes

Product catalogs & specs	Lack of digital skills, no centralized platform

Pricing & availability	Middlemen control, no real-time updates

Contact & location data	No verified listings, poor digital literacy

Online reviews & feedback	No e-commerce integration

Visual content (images)	Limited access to photography/design resources

Challenges:
•	Digital illiteracy among weavers and cooperative staff.

•	Fragmentation: hundreds of societies with no unified digital strategy.

•	Language barriers: most content is in English, not Telugu.

•	Low margins discourage investment in tech.

•	Legacy systems: manual record-keeping, no CRM or inventory tools.


#4. Impact on the Ecosystem:
The lack of online visibility creates ripple effects:

•	Manufacturers & weavers miss out on direct-to-consumer sales and fair pricing.

•	Suppliers struggle with demand forecasting and inventory planning.

•	Customers face difficulty discovering authentic handloom products.

•	Government schemes are underutilized due to poor awareness.

•	Missed opportunities in exports, tourism, and cultural branding.
